# FADE World Timers

# Timers
This addon tracks timers of many different world buffs and items.
Starting off with Onyxia, WCB Nefarian, Whipper Root Tubers and Songflower, but many more are to be added until the list is complete.

## Onyxia
When Horde or Alliance get the buff, a timer is put on your world map, and then broadcast to all your Guild members and raid members.

## Nefarian
When Horde or Alliance get the buff, a timer is put on your world map, and then broadcast to all your Guild members and raid members.

## Warchief's Blessing
Same as above

## Whipper Root Tubers
Felwood gathering timers are in the works, and currently we can sport both Whipper Root Tubers, and Songflowers!

## Songflower
It also keeps tracks of songflower timers!

## Commands
* /fade print -- Prints all active timers in the chat box, along with the time they're off CD
